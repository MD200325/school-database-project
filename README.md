# School Database Project (Practice)

This is a basic SQL database schema created as part of my learning journey in SQL and relational databases.

## What it Includes

- A `students` table and a `teachers` table with appropriate columns
- Constraints to enforce data integrity (e.g., primary keys, unique emails/phones)
- Minimal test data inserted (1 student, 1 teacher) for demonstration
- No real-world data â€” this is for **practice purposes only**

## Purpose

This project was built while following an online course to practice SQL table creation, database design, and schema documentation.
